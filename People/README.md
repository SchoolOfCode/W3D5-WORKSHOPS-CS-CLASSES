# People

## Task 1

Implement a `Speak` method in the `Person` class that when called prints `Hi, my name is {name}`.

## Task 2

Instantiate a new person in `Program.cs` and get them to talk!

## Task 3

Implement a `Tickle` method and a new field which can store a tickle count.

Each time `Tickle` is called, increment the tickle count and print `"He He!"`.

If the tickle count reaches a certain threshold, print `"STOP IT."` instead of `"He He!"`.

## Task 4

Have the tickle threshold taken into the constructor and stored in a field.

## Bonus

Add your own behavior to the person class.
